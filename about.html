	    <p>THE cat went here and there<br>
	    And the moon spun round like a top,<br>
	    And the nearest kin of the moon,<br>
	    The creeping cat, looked up.<br>
	    Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,<br>
	    For, wander and wail as he would,<br>
	    The pure cold light in the sky<br>
	    Troubled his animal blood.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    Minnaloushe runs in the grass<br>
	    Lifting his delicate feet.<br>
	    Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?<br>
	    When two close kindred meet.<br>
	    What better than call a dance?<br>
	    Maybe the moon may learn,<br>
	    Tired of that courtly fashion,<br>
	    A new dance turn.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br>
	    From moonlit place to place,<br>
	    The sacred moon overhead<br>
	    Has taken a new phase.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils<br>
	    Will pass from change to change,<br>
	    And that from round to crescent,<br>
	    From crescent to round they range?<br>
	    Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br>
	    Alone, important and wise,<br>
	    And lifts to the changing moon<br>
	    His changing eyes.
	    </p>
